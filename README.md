Overview
The document appears to describe a project named “SMART BLIND STICK FOR BLIND PEOPLE (ROBOTICS PROJECT)” by someone associated with “AIROBOTICS” and names like SirAnwar Siraj and OMetaAl.
It includes references to a circuit diagram (likely for a Hokey HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor) and a simple Arduino-based coding snippet.
The emphasis is on creating a sensing device for blind people, using ultrasonic distance measurement to trigger a buzzer and LED when an obstacle is close.

Connections listed (likely from the circuit diagram)
GND
HC-SR04 (ultrasonic sensor)
Pins labeled #10, #9, #11, etc.
Mentions UNO (Arduino Uno), POWER, ANALOG IN
References to digital PWM pin usage
Labels: 0012223415 (could be a part number, student id, or a model number)
The content indicates the ultrasonic sensor is wired to an Arduino Uno with:
trig wire to a PWM-capable digital pin
echo wire to a digital input pin
possibly a buzzer and LED connected to other digital pins

Section: CODING
Provided Arduino code snippet header:
Pin definitions:
const int trigPin = 9;
const int echoPin = 10;
const int buzzer = 11;
const int ledPin = 13;
Variables:
long duration;
int distance;
int safetyDistance;
setup() function:
Configures pins:
pinMode(trigPin- OUTPUT); (note: there is a likely typo; should be pinMode(trigPin, OUTPUT);)
pinMode(echoPin- INPUT); (typo; should be pinMode(echoPin, INPUT);)
pinMode(buzzer- OUTPUT); (typo; should be pinMode(buzzer, OUTPUT);)
pinMode(ledPin- OUTPUT); (typo; should be pinMode(ledPin, OUTPUT);)
Initializes serial communication with Serial.begin(9600);
The rest of the loop function begins but is cut off in the snippet:
It starts with:
Clearing the trig pin, generating a 10 µs pulse, reading the echo duration
Calculating distance with distance = duration * 0.034 / 2;
Setting safetyDistance to distance
If safetyDistance <= 5, turn on buzzer and LED; otherwise turn them off
Print the distance with Serial.print("Distance: "); and presumably Serial.println(distance);
Page 4
Continuation of the CODE section:
The line shows:
Serial.print("Distance: ");
Serial.println(distance);
Confirms the code prints distance readings to the serial monitor.
Page 5
The final page snippet reiterates the printing of distance to the Serial Monitor.
Technical Summary
Hardware:
Arduino Uno
HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor
Buzzer
LED
Common ground and power connections
Wiring (inferred from the text):
Trig pin of HC-SR04 connected to digital pin 9 (trigPin)
Echo pin of HC-SR04 connected to digital pin 10 (echoPin)
Buzzer connected to digital pin 11
LED connected to digital pin 13
GND and 5V connections to the sensor and peripherals
Software:
The provided Arduino sketch measures distance using the HC-SR04:
Sends a 10 µs pulse on trigPin
Measures the duration of the echo on echoPin
Converts duration to distance with distance ≈ duration × 0.034 / 2
If the measured distance is less than or equal to a safety threshold (5 cm shown in code), the buzzer and LED are activated to alert the user.
Distance values are printed to the Serial Monitor for debugging or monitoring.
Notable Observations / Potential Corrections
Typographical errors in pinMode calls:
pinMode(trigPin- OUTPUT); should be pinMode(trigPin, OUTPUT);
pinMode(echoPin- INPUT); should be pinMode(echoPin, INPUT);
pinMode(buzzer- OUTPUT); should be pinMode(buzzer, OUTPUT);
pinMode(ledPin- OUTPUT); should be pinMode(ledPin, OUTPUT);
The code snippet is incomplete in the provided pages; the typical loop structure would include:
A delay between measurements, and
The actual distance calculation formula is present, but ensure units and constants match the sensor’s datasheet (0.034 cm/µs constant is standard for beam speed in air; some use 343 m/s -> 0.0343 cm/µs).
The safety distance threshold is set to 5 (units: cm). Depending on the use-case, you might consider a larger alert distance for safer guidance.
There appears to be a focus on a “smart blind stick,” which would be a mobility aid for visually impaired users; consider additional features like haptic feedback (different vibration patterns) or auditory alerts for more accessibility.
The diagram text references “DIGITAL(PWM~)” and “ANALOGIN” which hints at more sensors or controls possibly connected; ensure consistent pin mapping in the code and wiring diagram.
The file’s title and content suggest a robotics project; for production use, include:
Debouncing or filtering of distance readings
Multiple obstacle distance checks to reduce false alerts
Safety codes and user testing notes
Clear schematic or circuit diagram image for assembly
Suggested Improvements (if you’re planning to use or present this)
Correct the syntax typos in the code and provide a complete, working sketch, for example:

  duration = pulseIn(echoPin, HIGH);

  Serial.print("Distance: ");
  Serial.println(distance);

}
